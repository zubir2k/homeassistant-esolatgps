Assalamu'alaikum

This is a custom integration for Home Assistant that will create a Prayer Time sensor based on Person's GPS coordinates.
The GPS-based prayer time API is provided by **[Malaysia Prayer Time](https://mpt.i906.my/)**.

Prayer time information are made as sensor attributes with the following format:
- 12 hours (e.g. 6:01 AM)
- 24 hours (e.g. 06:01:00)
- Datetime UTC (e.g. 2023-07-29T22:01:00+00:00)

This is a continuation of [HomeAssistantEsolatGPS](https://github.com/zubir2k/HomeAssistantEsolatGPS) (Appdaemon version)
